OpenLayers Editor (OLE) provides a set of controls for extended editing of spatial data.
This is the new version of OLE which is based on OpenLayers 4.
The old version using OpenLayers 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/geops/ole).

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add more controls and to extend the current functionality.
Additionally, the build process is currently very basic and could be optimized.
Translations would be nice, too.
